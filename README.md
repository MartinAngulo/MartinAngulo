A little bit about me:

🔭 I'm currently working on my soft skills as Teaching Assistant in Henry. <br/>
🌱 I'm currently learning new technologies like .NET, TypeScript, etc. <br/>
💬 Ask me about the projects that I've done for Henry and I'll be happy to help you.<br/>

"When someone teaches another, both learn...
that's why I love sharing my knowledge with everyone".
